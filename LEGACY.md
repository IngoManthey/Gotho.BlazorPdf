# Legacy 

This project was originally known as `MudBlazor.PdfViewer` and started life as a very simple PDF viewer for the MudBlazor framework.

As the library evolved the MudBlazor dependency was removed so any Blazor project could use the library.

Below are the original release notes for the now deprecated `Gotho.MudBlazor.PdfViewer` package.
