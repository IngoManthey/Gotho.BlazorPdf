# Contributing

The goal of this project is to provide a seamless, inline PDF viewing experience for any Blazor project.

This is achieved by interop code with Mozilla's [pdf-js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library. Most of the features the Blazor PDF provides are features available in the pdf-js library (document manipulation, text selection etc.)

## Building

In order to build the project locally you will need node and .NET 9 SDK installed.

Once you have checked out the repo you will need to run `npm install` in the following directories;

```
/Gotho.BlazorPdf
/Gotho.BlazorPdf.MudBlazor
```

You should now be able to build the solution.
